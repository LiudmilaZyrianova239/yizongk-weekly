*note: I made two accounts accidently, which I have edit on both.*

For this contribution, I look to my heart and found a itch that just bothers me so much. The lack of public restroom in New York. There actually is many public restroom, but there's no information on where they are and the hour they are open. So I look to the area I live in, in Queens. Nearby there's a public park next to a public school, and there's a public restroom there. I notice on Open Street Map, there's on information about such bathroom, so I made my edit there. Now I awaits approval. I plan to add a few more edit to this project about public restroom information.
