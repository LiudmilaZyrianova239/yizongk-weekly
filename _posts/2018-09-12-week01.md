*note: I made two accounts accidently, which I have edit on both.*

> For this contribution, I look to my heart and found a itch that just bothers me so much. The lack of public restroom in New York. There actually is many public restroom, but there's no information on where they are and the hour they are open. So I look to the area I live in, in Queens. Nearby there's a public park next to a public school, and there's a public restroom there. I notice on Open Street Map, there's on information about such bathroom, so I made my edit there. Now I awaits approval. I plan to add a few more edit to this project about public restroom information.

## Open Source Reading

#### Three significant things that Richard Stallman did for the free and open source software movement

> 1. Developing the GNU General Public License. Which was designed to protect freedom for all user using a particular program, providing respect for users' freedom. For example, to be able to run a OS that allow any outside software to be ran on it, not just software made by certain people.
> 2. Differientiating the two term: Free and Open Source. Describing it as "Free speech, not free beer". Free meaning not just price, but social idealogy, while Open Source describe more a technical method of developing software.
> 3. Founded the Free Sofrware Foundation. To promote the very core idea of Free software. The right to study the source code, modify it, and share. To have full control over their software. Especially in a near future where everything is becoming digital, being in control of these digital things will be core.

#### Two key principles in the development of Open Source by Eric Raymond that strikes me.

> 1. "Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer's personal itch." 
>> This out of all the process is the most important one to me. It is something that anyone can do, and will provide the most motivation to continuing doing so. It is human nature to find something, even something small, that just annoys the hell of them. When this happens, It's only natural to doing all you can do fix that annoyance. Who wants to be constanly pissed off? 
> 2. "When you lost interest in a program, your last duty to it is to hand it off to a competent successor."
>> To keep this Open Source culture alive, it needs to continue where anything is left off. The culture cannot afford much to start over from scratch everything a reoccuring problem arise. Espically, when proprietary software still flourish. Proprietary software often beats out the quality of Open Source software at the early stage of its life, because there's money involve. But overtime, Open Source will have better quality, and more dedicated users to help improve its quality. This essentailly means that if Open Source has to restart every time, it won't work. So to keep the quality of such a Open Source Software going, you must properly hand it off to another person.
