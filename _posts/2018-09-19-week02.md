> 1. I think the author's ban was treated fairly, but the article about Catalina Cruz was treated unfairly. The article have been cited many times, with many references. How creditible? I am not sure, I am not familiar with their source creditiblity. But base on pictures of the politician, Catalina Cruz is truly advertising the things she calim to be fighting for. This shows that Catalina is notable, in my view. So I would say that the article should be kept. 
> 2. Now to the question of whether the author have been treated fairly. I would say yes, she has been treated fairly. From her own word, she has said she is toxic when it comes to dicussion within the wikimedia community. Coming from personal experience, I find it very hard to be near a toxic person, or be willing to cooperate with that said person wihtout being mentally harmed. Seeing that it is a harmful situation to be in a community with the author, I said her ban is reasonable. But again, this has nothing to do with the quality of the author's work. I think her article on Catalina Cruz is well done.
> 3. The definition of notability is definetly reasonable. To be notable means that many can confirm something to be a fact. This means that Wikipedia will not have an article that tells lies. The whole world uses wikipedia, if the whole world lives off lies, that's not good. How does someone use this definition correctly comes down to convincing the editors who has the final say. Whoever has the final say, must be convinced that an article is credible, and the way to prove crediblity is by how many people can confirm a fact, and if many people know about a subject, that subject is notable. It seems very logical to me.
