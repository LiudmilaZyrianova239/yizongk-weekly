## Git work flow
### September 25th, 2018

> This week I get to do some practice with the git flow method called Integration Manager Workflow. I like the process over all, as it makes logical sense. Find a project that you want to work on, that is on a remote server such as github. Make a remote clone(fork) of that remote project(blessed repository) with your github account. Now you remotely own a copy of the project, while the original project is still around, but now your remote copy of the project have the ability to do pull request to ask for permission to merge your remote copy to the remote blessed repository. Your next job is to clone your remote fork to your local computer and start working on it. To set this up, you should also add a upstream connected to the blessed repository so you can pull updates from the blessed repository as you are not the only contributor, you will need to keep your copy of the project up to date with the blessed project. Now do your edits, add, commit, and push to your remote fork. Then on your github page with the fork, do a pull request to merge to the blessed repository. I like this process very much, it's been pretty fun to do so much and still be kept so organize.
