# About My Jekyll-based Blog Hosted on GitHub Pages

Jekyll is a simple, open-source, blog-aware, static site generator.
Jekyll is the engine behind GitHub Pages, so you can host your 
Jekyll blog on GitHubâ€™s servers for free. The difficult work has
already been done for you; all you have to do is some simple
user-specific tinkering in the repository that has been created for
you.
